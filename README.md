  <p>The TOHE project ceased development on May 20, 2023, with its final release being <a href="https://github.com/KARPED1EM/TownOfNext/releases/tag/v2.3.6">v2.3.6</a>.</p>
  <p>With the aim of continuing TOHE's legacy and providing a foundation for other forks, we rebuilt the project based on the new TOH base and renamed it to TONX. However, due to limited resources, TONX development has also been discontinued after version <a href="https://github.com/KARPED1EM/TownOfNext/releases/tag/v3.0.1">v3.0.1</a>.</p>
  <p>While the project remains open-source, active maintenance has ceased. We may review and accept certain compatibility-focused pull requests, but will only ensure their security aspects.</p>
  <p>We apologize that we cannot provide releases for versions beyond official maintenance. If you need them, please consider contacting the PR submitters or compiling the code yourself.</p>
